Serving maid exclaims that you are obviously pregnant. She asks about the father. You are evasive, but tell her that it's not one of your father's knights.

	<p>I would never lie to you, Margaret. My name in Tamlane. I used to be human. I am the son of an earl. But I went hunting one night, and I became very drowsy and fell off my horse. It was the Queen of the Fairies who caught me, and I have lived with her ever since. I am both her companion, and her prisoner. Oh, don't give me that look. It's actally quite lovely. I know neither sickness nor pain. I will never grow old. I can change shape, become as large or as small as I wish. I have never before desired to be mortal again. But tonight is Samhain, and every seven years, the faeries must offer one of their own to the devil in exchange for their continued safety. As I am so young and handsome, I fear that I would be the one sacrificed tonight. You must save me, my love. Tonight, the fairy court will travel across the land. You must wait for us at midnight at the bridge. You must take hold of me and hold tight to me, no matter what. No matter what, Margaret. Promise me this.</p>
