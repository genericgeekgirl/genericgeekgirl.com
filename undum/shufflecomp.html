	<p>The legend has it that a fae by the name of Tamlyn lives in the Wood, and he will demand a toll from anyone who wishes to visit. For a maiden as young and beautiful as you, the fee would likely be sexual in nature.</p>

	<p>You have barely plucked a single rose when a handsome young man shows up. He is about a foot taller than you and impossibly slender.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="situation" id="apologize">
	<p>You stammer an apology. The young man smiles broadly. "Madam, in exchange for a kiss, I would allow you to take all the roses you wish." You blush, but allow him to kiss you.</p>

	<h1>Three months later...</h1>
	<p>Return home. Three months pass. You're miserable, and in your room. You look terrible. You haven't combed your hair. You haven't wanted to venture out, because you've been throwing up each morning and are beginning to put on weight. And worst, you haven't had your period in three months. Serving maid exclaims that you are obviously pregnant. She asks <a href="father">about the father</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="situation" id="father">
	<p>You are evasive, but tell her that it's not one of your father's knights. Sensing your anxiety, she suggests a bitter herb that you can find in the woods that will terminate the pregnancy. You leap out of bed and <a href='returntowoods'>return to the woods</a>.</p>

      <div class="situation" id="pickherb">
	<p>You've barely picked a single leaf when the young man reappears.</p>
	<p>"My darling," he cries," I plead with you. Please do not take that herb. Please do not harm yourself or my child. Why would you wish to do such a thing?"</p>
	<p>You respond that if only he would human, you would happily keep the child. But since he cannot marry you, you want it gone.</p>
	<p>He assures you that he is, in fact, human, and he tells you his <a href="tamlanestale2">tale</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div id="tamlanestale">
	<p>I would never lie to you, Margaret. My name in Tamlane. I used to be human. I am the son of an earl. But I went hunting one night, and I became very drowsy and fell off my horse. It was the Queen of the Fairies who caught me, and I have lived with her ever since. I am both her companion, and her prisoner. It's actally quite lovely.</p>
	<p>Oh, don't give me that look. I know neither sickness nor pain. I will never grow old. I can change shape, become as large or as small as I wish. I have never before desired to be mortal again. But tonight is Samhain, and every seven years, the faeries must offer one of their own to the devil in exchange for their continued safety. As I am so young and handsome, I fear that I would be the one sacrificed tonight. You must save me, my love. Tonight, the fairy court will travel across the land. You must wait for us at midnight at the bridge. You must take hold of me and hold tight to me, no matter what. No matter what, Margaret. Promise me this.</p>

      <div id="takeherb" class="situation">
        <p>You don't believe Tamlane's silly story. You call your serving maid and give her the bitter herb. She brews it into a tea for you. It works as stated. In fact, it works too well. You call for help, but none comes. You are dead before morning.</p>

      <div class="situation" id="nakedman">
	<p>You throw the hot coal into the river. It has barely made a splash before it transforms into a naked man. He shivers, but grins at you despite the chill. You pull him from the water and wrap him up in your cloak and hold him tightly against your breast.</p>
	<p>"We've won, Tamlane," you cry. "<a href='last'>We've won!</a>"</p>

      <div class="situation" id="last">
	<p>The Queen of Fairies is very angry, but accepts her defeat. "Tamlane," she says, "I knew I should have ripped out your eyes and replaced them with wood. I knew I should have ripped out your heart and replaced it with a stone. You have been stolen from me."</p>
	<p>You bring your love home with you and introduce him to your father. Your father recognizes him immediately. Tamlane is exactly whom he claimed to be. You are married the next morning.</p>
