	    <h2>Software and Web Development</h2>
	    
	    <h3>Independent Software Developer</h3>
	    <h6>September 2013 &ndash; Present</h6>
	    
	    <p>I have been using this time to work on personal projects. I have released three games and am currently working on a large project titled <span class="italic">Imagine a World</span>, written in Inform 7 and Perl. I maintain several websites as a way to further develop my skills with CSS and Javascript. I am also teaching myself Python and Ruby.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Bioinformatics Developer</h3>
	    <h5>Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</h5>
	    <h6>April 2011 &ndash; September 2013</h6>
	    
	    <p>I was the lead developer and maintainer of internal- and external-facing websites within a Perl/Catalyst framework. The internal website functions as a laboratory management system with a MySQL backend, and provides a web-based interface to facilitate assay design.</p>
	    
	    <p>Other projects included improving in-house software usability and maintainability; creating modules for simplified logging, email notifications and database abstraction; developing automated tools to sync a local database with UCSC&#8217;s human genome database; and advocating and implementing sound software development practices such as version control, bug tracking and an internal wiki (Subversion, Trac).</p>
	    
	    <p>Additionally, I was responsible for monitoring production and testbed MySQL servers and ensuring integrity of data, as well as configuration and package management on four virtual machines (CentOS via VMWare), utilizing NFS to share data between them.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Bioinformatics Specialist</h3>
	    <h5>Harvard Medical School</h5>
	    <h6>March 2010 &ndash;  April 2011</h6>
	    
	    <p>I was the lead developer (backend and frontend) of a web application (&ldquo;GFY&rdquo;) to automate processing and analysis of mass spectrometry data. I integrated existing data analysis tools into an in-house PHP-based framework; designed and built graphical user interfaces around command-line scripts; refactored and maintained scripts to visualize spectral data on the web; and redesigned GFY&#8217;s data browser to reduce load times.</p>
	    
	    <h3>Bioinformatics Analyst</h3>
	    <h5>Sol Genomics Network, Boyce Thompson Institute</h5>
	    <h6>June 2005 &ndash;  March 2010</h6>
	    
	    <p>I wrote and maintained Perl scripts to process genomic data and present it on the SGN websites; integrated existing genomic analysis tools into an in-house Perl-based framework; provided web interfaces for existing command-line genomics software (Primer3, BLAST); and developed the PerlCyc API to Pathway Tools, a Lisp-based software environment for working with model organism databases. Additionally, I worked directly with users, responding to requests to collate and export data, submit data to GenBank, and design primers using a custom pipeline built around Primer3. I also developed and maintained internal and end-user wikis using MoinMoin.</p>
